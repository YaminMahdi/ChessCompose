  - Define PieceType, PieceColor, and GameStatus enums
  - Implement Position validation and utility functions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Use chess piece for ImageVectors










  - Use ImageVector resources for all 6 piece types (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn) from `app/src/main/java/com/mlab/chess`, file name ends with -b for black, -w for white, 
  - Ensure consistent sizing and Material Design compliance

- [ ] 3.2 Implement individual piece movement rules
  - Code Pawn movement (forward, diagonal capture)
  - Code Rook movement (horizontal/vertical lines)
  - Code Bishop movement (diagonal lines)
  - Code Queen movement (combination of rook/bishop)
  - Code Knight movement (L-shaped moves)
  - Code King movement (one square any direction)
  - Write unit tests for each piece movement pattern
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 3.3 Implement game state validation
  - Create check detection logic
  - Implement turn validation (only current player can move)
  - Add move legality validation before execution
  - Write unit tests for game state validation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Create core UI components
- [ ] 4.1 Implement ChessBoard composable
  - Create 8x8 grid layout with alternating colors
  - Implement touch event handling for square selection
  - Add visual feedback for selected squares
  - Use Material 3 color scheme for board squares
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.5_

- [ ] 4.2 Implement ChessPiece composable
  - Create composable that renders pieces using ImageVectors
  - Add selection highlighting with animation
  - Implement piece positioning within board squares
  - Add accessibility content descriptions
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 4.3 Implement valid move indicators
  - Create visual indicators for valid destination squares
  - Add subtle animations for move indicators
  - Ensure indicators are clearly visible but not distracting
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Create game state management
- [ ] 5.1 Implement ChessGameViewModel
  - Create ViewModel with StateFlow for game state
  - Implement piece selection logic
  - Add move execution with validation
  - Implement turn switching after valid moves
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 5.2 Implement game state updates
  - Handle piece capture and removal
  - Update valid moves when piece is selected
  - Manage current player turn indication
  - Ensure immutable state updates
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4, 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Add animations and visual feedback
- [ ] 6.1 Implement piece movement animations
  - Add smooth animation for piece moves from source to destination
  - Implement piece capture animations with removal effects
  - Use animateFloatAsState for position transitions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_

- [ ] 6.2 Implement selection and interaction animations
  - Add piece selection highlighting with scale/color animation
  - Implement hover effects for valid move squares
  - Add visual feedback for invalid move attempts
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 5.2_

- [ ] 7. Create game status UI
  - Implement GameStatusBar composable showing current player turn
  - Add visual indication of whose turn it is
  - Display game state clearly (active, check, checkmate)
  - Ensure status updates immediately with state changes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Integrate components and test complete game flow
  - Wire together all components in main game screen
  - Test complete move sequences from piece selection to move completion
  - Verify turn switching works correctly
  - Test piece capture functionality
  - Ensure all animations work smoothly together
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5, 3.5, 4.1, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Add game initialization and reset functionality
  - Implement initial board setup with all pieces in starting positions
  - Create game reset functionality
  - Ensure game works completely offline
  - Test app launch and initial state
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_
