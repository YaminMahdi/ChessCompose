# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete two-player chess game using Jetpack Compose with modern animated UI. The game will be fully offline, using ImageVectors for chess pieces, and will include visual feedback for piece selection and valid moves. The implementation focuses on simplicity while maintaining a polished user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to see a complete chess board with all pieces in their starting positions, so that I can begin a game of chess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display an 8x8 chess board with alternating light and dark squares
2. WHEN the board is displayed THEN the system SHALL show all 32 chess pieces in their standard starting positions
3. WHEN pieces are displayed THEN the system SHALL use ImageVectors for all piece representations (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn) for both white and black pieces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to select and move pieces by tapping, so that I can play the game intuitively on a touch device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap on a piece that belongs to the current player THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected piece
2. WHEN a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL show all valid moves for that piece with visual indicators
3. WHEN I tap on a valid destination square THEN the system SHALL move the piece to that square with smooth animation
4. WHEN I tap on an invalid square while a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL deselect the piece
5. WHEN I tap on another piece of the same color while a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL select the new piece instead

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the game to enforce chess rules, so that only legal moves are allowed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's white's turn THEN the system SHALL only allow white pieces to be selected and moved
2. WHEN it's black's turn THEN the system SHALL only allow black pieces to be selected and moved
3. WHEN a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL calculate and display only legally valid moves according to chess rules
4. WHEN a move would result in capturing an opponent's piece THEN the system SHALL remove the captured piece from the board
5. WHEN a move is completed THEN the system SHALL switch turns to the other player

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to see smooth animations and modern UI feedback, so that the game feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a piece is moved THEN the system SHALL animate the piece smoothly from source to destination
2. WHEN a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with highlighting or scaling animation
3. WHEN valid moves are shown THEN the system SHALL display them with subtle animations or visual effects
4. WHEN pieces are captured THEN the system SHALL animate their removal from the board
5. WHEN the UI updates THEN the system SHALL use modern Material Design principles with appropriate colors and spacing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want clear visual feedback about game state, so that I always know whose turn it is and what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whose turn it is (white or black)
2. WHEN a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from unselected pieces
3. WHEN valid moves are available THEN the system SHALL show them with clear visual indicators on the target squares
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update all visual indicators immediately
5. WHEN no piece is selected THEN the system SHALL show the board in its neutral state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the game to work completely offline, so that I can play without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched without internet connection THEN the system SHALL function normally
2. WHEN playing the game THEN the system SHALL not require any network requests
3. WHEN the app is used THEN the system SHALL store all game logic and assets locally
4. WHEN pieces are displayed THEN the system SHALL use locally defined ImageVectors rather than external resources
